## Learning Activities & Resources

- This week I started with watching some linkden learning videos which were in the course.
   [Linkden learning video Agile at Work: Driving Productive Agile Meetings](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/agile-at-work-driving-productive-agile-meetings/increase-efficiency-in-your-agile-meetings?u=2223545)

- Then I followed the instructions and linked Github classroom to slack.
- I copied the template for trello board and created a new board for our team.

## Estimated Hours of Learning

- 2 hours

## Content Insights

I learned the following from the video:
Keep the discussion focused and brief. The duration of an agile meeting should not exceed 30 minutes.
Maintain focus by using an agenda. Before the meeting, the agenda should be distributed to all attendees.
Encourage everyone to participate. Keep the conversation from being dominated by one or two persons.
Quickly make decisions. Agile teams must have the ability to act rapidly to stay on course.
After the meeting, follow up. Publish a summary of the conversation and any choices reached.

We can interact with our team members more productively by merging these three tools, GitHub, Trello and Slack. Additionally, we can keep up with the most recent developments and work more conveniently with my team members on projects.
The update feature from trello and Github to slack is very useful. It will help us to keep track of the progress of the project.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I will become more valuable if I can use Slack, GitHub, and Trello. Web development teams frequently utilise these technologies, thus knowing how to use them well can be a useful advantage.I can be more effective in various roles if I can learn how to conduct effective agile meetings. Agile meetings are an essential element of the agile development process, and managing them well will help myÂ team stay on task and deliver outstanding output.
