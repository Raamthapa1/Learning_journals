## Content Insights

This week I learned how a WordPress site can get hacked if you don't set it up in a secure way. The web server, network connections, passwords, and file permissions can all let a hacker in if they are not locked down tight. Some important things are keeping all the software and WordPress updated so there are no holes for hackers to use. Also, having really strong passwords that are unique, and using two-step login for important accounts so hackers can't guess the passwords. Checking that your network is encrypted on both ends stops hackers from seeing information. Being careful what files WordPress can change prevents hackers from adding bad code. Always installing WordPress, plugin and theme updates is key because those updates fix problems. By doing these things I now understand way better how to make a WordPress site really secure.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

AKnowing how to make WordPress sites really secure will help me get web developer jobs. WordPress is used on so many websites, so companies need people who can properly lock down WordPress. I will keep learning about new WordPress security problems that come up and how to fix them. That way I can always make sites super secure. In job interviews I can talk about my WordPress security skills. That will show I have important skills that other candidates may not have. I also want to expand my security knowledge into other platforms besides WordPress.
