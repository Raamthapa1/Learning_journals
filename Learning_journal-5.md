## Content Insights

Child theme is a great way of keeping our changes and work safe. If we made any custom changes in the parent theme itself it gonna reset when it gets updated. We also need update for security and new features, so the best way is to create a child theme and save our custom changes within the child theme. A child theme is like mask over our parent theme, you can dribble around and make changed in the child theme without customising the parent theme and you can be sure that you are not ruining the parent theme. You also need to keep the parent theme installed to run the child theme as it is just a cover for parent theme.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Wordpress actually offers a lot of customization but there is a limit in it. So fiding a way to make the customization without worriying about the parent theme was a great deal for me. You can easily add a function which is not a part of a theme and we dont need to change the whole theme for this. This feature will be very haelpful in meeting clients requirement in future. Small customization options to make a site look better then the default theme site will help a developer to look professional. As it is being really easy for anyone to built a theme and template based website now adays with the help of CMSs. I belive child theme will help us stand out from the crowd.
