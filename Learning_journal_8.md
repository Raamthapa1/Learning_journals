So my theory is to use functions effectiively which also supports the donot repeat after yourself principle, will make the site more effective and smooth.

From my point of view if i use he functions and dont repeat myself it will be easier to add new features to the site and also it will load faster.

To test this feature we can crate two sites one with functions properly used and followed the DRY principle and the other one without using functions and repeating the code.

The following test will help me to prove my hypothesis.

- The loading time of the sites.
- The time taken to add new features to the site.
- Time take to make changes to the site.

The expeted result form the above test will be in the favour of the site with functions and DRY principle. With this we can sonclude that the hypothesis statement is proven and we can use functions and DRY principle to make the site more effective and smooth.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I leaerned alot of things during this experiment. I learned how to use functions and how to use them effectively. I also learned how to use the DRY principle to make the site more effective and smooth. I am sure that this principle will help me in my carrer. As i ecpect that this is the standard procedure that is beingfollowed in the industry, this will help me in collabaration or taking someone else project to complete it or make updates.
