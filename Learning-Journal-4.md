## Content Insights
As I was introduced to two CMS in the course, Joomla and Wordpress. This week i am learning about Wordpress. I found wordpress fairly easy to use in comparision with joomla. As a widely used CMS in the world wordpress is used more than 43% of the whole web. The page edit and post function was easy to catchup and templates were also widely available


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing my 3rd practical, I Had my First experience In Wordpress CMS. This was so easy for web development. AS one of the popular CMS, I hope to see it everywhere in the industry and it will be easy for me to catcup. There are also many different training and courses online and I believe that will help me in mastering wordpress in future. Wordpress skills wil be a golden skill in web development.
