## Content Insights
I found xaamp as an aawesome tool for local hosting. However, I was not able to run xaamp on my device due to some port problem. I did some extra research about fixing the problem, which gave me an out of box experience. AFter doing some trouble shooting and getting help form my lecturer, i was still stuck with the problem and as a lender of last resort i had to reset my windows. After that i Installed joomla and xaamp was running smoothly. The process of installing was fairly easy but i found the content handelling style bit challenging. With the help of videos and instruction from our lecturer i was able to develope a basic joomla site.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

With this I am Confidence that i will be able to cope easily with most of the CMSs in coming time. As an extra knowledge i gained some experience in xaamp usage and troubleshooting as well, which i belive will be an important skill for my carrer.
