  <h2>Reflection and Insights</h2>
  <p>Describe your learning and experience creating sites using the two different CMSs.
<li>Wordpress - I found Wordpress very easy to install. It has a easy interface. The major components 
  such as pages, post and medias are easy to find and use. I found it easy to install plugins and themes. 
</li>
<br>
<li>Joomla - Joomla was also fairley easy to install, After installation It was bit tricky at fisrt to manage it. Installation of themes and plugins are also bit complicated because we have to do it manually.</li>

<br>
Overall learning experience was really great. I explored powerful plugins, themes and features of both CMSs. I found Wordpress more user friendly and easy to use. But Joomla has more features and customization options.
For example, when I was uploading a CEO message video to both my websites, I found that Joomla has more options to customize the video.
 I was able to change video frame size and also align it to centre. But in Wordpress I was not able to do that, the video was in original size and no option for alignment just for video. The inbuilt store for themes and plugin is great in
 werdpress, which i believe will be very handy for future projects. Wordpress is begineer friendly CMS whereas Joomla is more advanced and and will take time to learn.

  <p>Describe your learning and experience with your chosen hosting.</p>
  <p> I used <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/shared/">namecheap</a> for hosting my websites. I found the interface begineer friendly.
    It was installed with cPanel 110.0.7. File Manager was easy to navigate around and create multiple folders. Managing domains and SSL certificarion was also easy. It also comes with myphp admin and my sql database which is very handy for CMSs.
    Installation of CMS was also easy. I was able to install both Wordpress and Joomla with few clicks. I also got a email with my domain name which is easy for contacting purposes.
</body>Overall the learning experience was great. I was able to get things done what I wanted to.
