## Content Insights

I learnt many things about PhP, It's a serverside scripting technology. It a well istablished language and its been more than 20 years in market. The code is executed on server before reaching the client. php can also be used to connect to my SQL database which can be very useful while creating dynamic website. Overall php is very easy language to learn if the basics html and css are clear. It was a quite unique experience to learn php as it is very different from other languages, the most  unique part is declearing a variable with $ sign.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

There are unlimited opportunities for php developers in the market such as web develper, back-end developer, freelancer and many more. It was a smooth experinece for learning basics of php as it is very similar to other languages. I am looking forward to learn more about php and create a website connected with database. I think the use of functions will make alot of possibilities and options.
